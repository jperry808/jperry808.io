Stack overflow is a vault of knowledge built upon years and years of developers and software engineers alike honing their craft and assisting less experienced developers. With no limit to the amount of brilliant minds that can indulge in Stack Overflow, some developers end up giving off the wrong impression. There are tons of forums online talking about their poor experiences on Stack Overflow, and how nobody is answering their questions. Now sometimes they’re right and at the end of the day, it’s just not possible for everybody to have an amazing experience, but a lot of times they aren’t. The tech professionals that educate young minds on Stack Overflow don’t always have time to figure out what you are trying to say, and it can be incredibly frustrating for them to see all these questions that can be solved with a simple Google search. With that being said, I’m here to understand both perspectives and share with you a method of ensuring the questions you ask are well formulated and won’t result in embarrassment. 

## Prior to asking questions…	

Now before you publish your question to Stack Overflow or whatever forum you choose, make sure you conduct your own research beforehand. Start by searching for your own question to see if it has already been answered. Many programmers have encountered the exact same problem you currently face and just like you they thought to post a question to Stack Overflow in hopes of getting an answer. Take advantage of the resources available to you and make sure you exhaust every option before seeking additional help.

So now you’ve gathered information and found out a little bit more about how to go about solving your problem, but you still don’t have the answer! Now is the time to think about posting to a forum.

## The “NOT” so smart way

An example of a question that does not obey the rules established earlier would be ASH’s question, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32627456/how-to-define-a-constructor-outside-class-in-java"><i class="large github icon "></i>“how to define a constructor outside class in java?”</a>. We are Borg, the user who first commented on this post said it best, “Wouldn’t a simple google search reveal this?” and he is in fact 100% correct. We cant necessarily go back and try to google this question back in 2015 to see for sure but even if ASH did research himself he surely didn’t make it seem like he did. His question wasn’t prepared well, and it left a sour taste in many developers mouths leading to his post getting a whopping -27 score.

## The smart way	

Let’s look an example of a question that does obey the rules of netiquette and asking questions online, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array"><i class="large github icon "></i>“Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?”</a> by GManNickG is a perfect example. He sought out advice on why his array of sorted data finished running after 1.93 seconds whereas his array of unsorted data finished running after 11.54 seconds. He demonstrated professionalism by showing his code and explaining it, sharing his own thoughts about the problem, reinstating his question, and attaching related forums for reference. GManNickG’s professionalism resulted in his post getting a score of 27,333 and almost 2million views! The answers below the forum are just as well formulated as his question and really help the reader understand why the problem occurred.

## In Conclusion

As we found out from the two referenced Stack Overflow posts, putting some thought into what you post leads to a well formulated answer that helps you and other developers find the answers they seek. Not knowing the answer is okay, I find the never ending journey of not knowing something, finding what you did wrong, and then developing a deeper understanding of the topic to be a joyous thing. Don’t be afraid to post online but just make sure if you do, you do it the smart way.
