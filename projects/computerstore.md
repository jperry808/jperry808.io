**Project Overview**
This project was created as a way to demonstrate proficiency in object oriented programming in Java. Some things that had to be implemented for this assignment include: input verification, throwing exceptions, and having the code continue despite any errors or faulty input.

**Technical Challenges and Learning**
While the project in itself was not relatively hard, the hardships came in all the tiny errors I had to be wary of and make sure that the program catches the errors or does not allow them.

Some of the input validation included:
- Barcode must be from 10001 - 99999
- OS must be 1-3 (1 being Windows, 2 being MacOS and 3 being Linux)
- Price must be from 50-25000
- Barcodes cannot be duplicate
- Must delete computer objects by the barcode

**Outcome and Reflections**
Through this project I deepened my foundational programming skills, especially in object oriented programming. Input validation and handing exceptions helped me understand how to handle real-world scenarios and solve problems that I will surely encounter in the future.
