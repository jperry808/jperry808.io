**Project Overview**
This is a project made with the IDE jGrasp for my ICS 211 course at The University of Hawaii at Manoa. This project was made to demonstrate proficiency in using Java's GUI elements and Java's File.io feature.

This project uses JButtons, TextFields, JLabels to create a user friendly, completely working, and interactable game of Keno. The objective is to select 10 numbers of your choice and get money (or lose money) based on whether you guessed the same numbers as the computer or not.

**Technical Challenges and Learning**
One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the game works exactly like a normal game of Keno would. Things like making sure users cannot select more than 10 buttons to keeping track of the total winnings and losses proved to be difficult. Another challenge was making sure that the interface itself is user friendly and easy to understand. I chose to color code the buttons so the user can easily tell what is going on.

**Outcome and Reflections**
This project was overall a success, I learned so many things about how GUI in Java works, along with getting valuable experience on building interactive user interfaces. I also learned about how to manage effective output operations with Java's File.io feature. This was overall my first real challenge as a programmer and it still to this day is one of the most fun projects I've made.
