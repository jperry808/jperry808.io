# Project Overview
This project is a passion project created by me and my friend. We started developing this game over the summer to demonstrate proficiency in Unity for future internships and job opportunities in the field of game development. This project involved using issue-driven management with GitHub and integrating physics based interactions with collision detection systems providing realistic in-game dynamics.

# Team Collaboration and Roles
The player combat, movement, and title screen were created by me. The background assets were also created by me through Aseprite. My peer primarily focused on the level design, player interactions, and in game effects ie. weather, background animations, etc.

# Technical Challenges and Learning
Developing a game in Unity proved to be much more of a challenge than we could of anticipated, going from coding school projects on Java to using all the various built in Unity functions was overwhelming to say the least. From figuring out combat interactions to comboing attacks together the hardships seemed to be never ending. Despite the overwhelming challenges, developing Pixelfighter significantly expanded my problem solving skills and deepened my understanding of game development.

# Outcome and Reflections
Creating Pixelfighter has taught me so much about creating assets for video games, coding basic combat scripts, and making gameplay and movement feel smooth for maximum enjoyment amongst players.

Although this project is on hold now due to conflicts with school, by the end of the year Pixelfighter will be complete and it'll be time to work on something even better.
